In this repository, I present a few data projects in which I have participated.

# Quantitative UXR Project

I conducted a survey project in collaboration with 5 other user researchers at Tech Fleet Professional Association from	June 2023 to Oct 2023. 
The goal of this project is to understand the pain points of tech job seekers and craft a product for job seekers to manage their mental health on a day-to-day basis.
Here is a summary of the project and my contributions:

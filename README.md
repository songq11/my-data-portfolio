In this repository, I present a few data projects in which I have participated.

# User Research for a Job Seeking App

I conducted a survey project in collaboration with 5 other user researchers at Tech Fleet Professional Association from	June 2023 to Oct 2023. 
The goal of this project is to understand the pain points of tech job seekers and craft a product for job seekers to manage their mental health on a day-to-day basis.
Here is a summary of the project and my contributions:

# Data Analytics - What predicts coffee quality?

I conducted this project with 4 other women data analysts at the Data Science for All Bootcamp in the summer of 2023. 
The goal of this project is to provide advanced coffee information for coffee lovers through visualization.
